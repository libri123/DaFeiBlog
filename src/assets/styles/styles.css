	Verde Moderna by Dave Shea

	10 Years. http://mezzoblue.com/archives/2013/05/07/10_years/


	We've come a long way. Here it is, the first of what will hopefully be
	many more modern designs in the CSS Zen Garden.

	With this design, I've attempted to hit as many of today's front end
	buzzwords as possible. It's a mobile-first, responsive layout that was
	designed in the browser from start to finish. CSS3 is used liberally
	with fallbacks where necessary.

	All photos are mine, and were taken in the Japanese Garden at the
	Huntington Botanical Garden in Southern California.


	Other production notes:

	* Vector assets are used where appropriate. The logo is an SVG file,
	  the icons are a custom web font built with icomoon.io

	* The column effect is a CSS gradient instead of a background image.
	  By forcing a sharp transition at 66%, we can simulate columns. The way
	  Chrome rounds gradient values causes the columns to jump unexpectedly when
      the window is resized, which means that using an equal padding or width
      value doesn't align the way you think it would. That forced a bit of
      extra contortion to get the header and body columns perfectly lined up.

	* Various sidebar H3s were hidden with display:none; This was a design
	  decision. Their inclusion seemed extraneous. Same goes for HTML/CSS
      download links at low screen sizes, presumably that screen is a phone
      and can't download the files anyway.

	* The sidebar positioning style is (necessarily) quite a mess on wider
      windows, especially the resource list. When flexbox is a bit closer to
      usable, maybe I'll take another crack at fixing that up.

	* A more logical place for the design list to appear in the mobile
	  version would have been up closer to the top, possibly disclosed with a
      menu toggle of some kind. Not something that's easily doable with CSS
      alone, if you don't want to rely on hovers.

	* The medium- and low-res versions don't differ that much; I may still push
	  the tablet layout a bit further, it doesn't quite feel right.

	* Parallax scrolling isn't doable without Javascript so you won't find it
	  in this design. I was able to use a bit of multiple background-position
	  trickery to create a slightly more interesting scrolling effect.
